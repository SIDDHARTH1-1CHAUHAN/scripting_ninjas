# TradeOptimize AI: Revenue + Business Model + USP (Hackathon Short Version)

Prepared on: 2026-02-21

## 1) Business Model

TradeOptimize AI is positioned as a B2B trade-operations platform for importers.

- Core model: SaaS subscriptions (`Free`, `Starter`, `Growth`, `Enterprise`)
- Expansion model: usage-based overages for high-volume workflows
- Add-on model: membership service for compliance advisory and playbooks
- Enterprise model: onboarding and integration services

## 2) Pricing Structure (Short Form)

- `Free`: evaluation tier with limited monthly actions
- `Starter`: $149/month for small import teams
- `Growth`: $499/month for scaling teams with API and higher usage caps
- `Enterprise`: $1,499+/month for SLA, SSO, advanced support, and custom workflows

Example overages:
- Text classification: $0.03/request
- Image classification: $0.08/request
- Compliance checks: $0.05/request
- API: $2 per 10,000 calls

## 3) Revenue Streams

1. Recurring SaaS subscriptions (primary recurring revenue)
2. Usage overages (scales with customer volume)
3. Membership add-on ($99/month) for clinics/templates/updates
4. Onboarding and custom integration fees for enterprise customers

## 4) USP (Unique Selling Proposition)

TradeOptimize AI combines five import-critical workflows in one product:

1. HS classification (text + image)
2. Landed-cost and duty impact estimation
3. Compliance and sanctions checks with document tracking
4. Route optimization and shipment visibility
5. AI assistant for guided trade decisions

Why this is differentiated:
- Import-focused workflow depth, not generic AI chat
- Faster decision cycle across compliance + cost + logistics in one interface
- Clear ROI story: reduced duty leakage, fewer compliance misses, faster execution

## 5) 30-Second Pitch

TradeOptimize AI helps import teams classify products, estimate landed costs, validate compliance, and optimize routes from one dashboard. Customers start free, upgrade as shipment and compliance volume grows, and can add a membership layer for ongoing regulatory support and execution playbooks.
